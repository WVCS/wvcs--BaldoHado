          Hi, I'm Adam and I like to play tennis, play violin, code, and play video games. 
        </span>
        <span>
          My most fluent languages are currently HTML and CSS but I am learning JS and C++. I find HTML and CSS 
          to be fairly easy. I am currently coding a website for a nonprofit organization with my knowledge
          of these two languages. In the future, I hope to be a software enginneer or a web dev. 
        </span>

          Tennis is my favorite sport and I enjoy playing casually and competitively. In my free time,
          I usually practice violin or play video games with my friends.
